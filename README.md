# puzzle-solver
Solves various different types of puzzles using the wave function collapse algorithm + recursion

## How to use
* run indiviual puzzle scripts if you want to use the sucky input
* run "gui.py" to open the gui
* loading "TestGui" will give you a preview of the user experience for the gui

## Dev plan
 * after that the sidebar on the left will also be implemented with buttons for:
   - generating an image of the current board state
   - generating an easily shareable code that uniquely identifies the puzzle type and board state
   - loading such a code into the program
   - "unsolving" a puzzle: returning the board to the state before the puzzle was solved
   - settings (?)
 * and finally after all that other stuff i will start making solvers and input guis for as many puzzles as possible

## Goal
My ultimate goal is to have a solver for every type of puzzle that has ever been featured in the VTK Gent Manna

## Helping
Please help me if you want, by writing reduce functions and guis!
